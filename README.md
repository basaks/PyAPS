# PyAPS 
This repo starts from the PyAPS code I could download from google code archive from here: https://code.google.com/archive/p/pyaps/downloads

More recent code may exist here: http://earthdef.caltech.edu/


## Run eraptr2rdr.py

This is how I can run the `eraptr2rdr.py`: 

    python bin/eraptr2rdr.py examples/20061016.dat examples/dem_16rlks.hgt output 5.6 23
    
This creates the `output` file.
